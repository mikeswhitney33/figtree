FIGTree
=======

This is a forked version of FIGTree originally found here: https://github.com/vmorariu/figtree.

In this version, I have stripped out any unecessary files and made it easier to interface with python.
To build the library simply perform the following command from figtree's root directory:
```
# for building in place:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# for adding to your system libraries:
python setup.py install
```
